# Movie Recommendation System
## **Introduction**  
This **Movie Recommendation System** project is built using **Streamlit and The Movie Database (TMDB) API**. It allows users to search for a movie and get recommendations based on similar titles. The goal of this project is to explore API integration and basic data handling in Python.
## How Does It Work  
1. You enter a movie name in the search bar.  
2. The app fetches details about the movie, including its title, release year, rating, and an overview.  
3. It also provides a list of similar movies based on the TMDB recommendation system.  

## What You Need to Run This Project  
- Python3
- A TMDB API Key from https://www.themoviedb.org/

## **Setting Up the Project**  

1. **Download the project**  
2. **Install the required libraries**  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Customise by adding your TMDB API key in `app.py`**  
   API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
4. **Run the application**  
   streamlit run app.py
   
## **Features**  
- Search for any movie and get its details.
- See a list of **recommended** movies based on the one you searched.
- Get real-time movie data using TMDB API.

## **Future Improvements**  
- Allow users to filter recommendations by genre.
